# Abstract

This project involves the development of a mobile application aimed at the Android platform, which will allow the calculation of the physical condition of any person, especially older adults. The detection and measurement of the test development will be carried out using one of the sensors available on current phones. 
There will also be a section where the user can save the results of each test under the name he chooses, data that will be stored in a local databasefor later reference.
